Doorknob
========

Doorknob is the name of the database wrapper which wraps finding data in the
database into nice functions with human-readable exceptions. While the only
implementation of Doorknob uses MongoDB, other implementations are possible
thanks to abstracting all the functions into an abstract base class. This
documentation will document based on that abstract base class rather than
the MongoDB implementation directly.
