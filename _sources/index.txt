Wonderland Engine |version| Documentation
=======================================

Overview
--------

The Cheshire Cyber Defense Scoring Engine aims to be a highly flexible scoring
engine for use in Cybersecurity competitions. Inspired by the Pacific Rim
Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Cheshire aims to allow greater modularity
for administrators, while also allowing automation of some currently
unautomated procedures. Using MongoDB, Redis, Flask, and Sphinx, it will score
any type of cyber defense competition, big or small, using different
types of pluggable checks. It was designed and programmed from the ground up by
Alexander Abbott during the summer and fall of 2012, and is available under the
GNU Affero Public License.
