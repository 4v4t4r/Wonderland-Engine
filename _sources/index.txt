Wonderland Engine |version| Documentation
=========================================

Overview
--------

The Wonderland Cyber Defense Scoring Engine aims to be a highly flexible
scoring engine for use in Cybersecurity competitions. Inspired by the Pacific
Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Wonderland aims to allow greater
modularity for administrators, while also allowing automation of some currently
unautomated procedures. Using MongoDB, Redis, Flask, and Sphinx, it will score
any type of cyber defense competition, big or small, using different
types of pluggable checks. It was designed and programmed from the ground up by
Alexander Abbott during the summer and fall of 2012, and is available under the
GNU Affero Public License.
