Wonderland Cyber Defense Scoring Engine
===============

The Cheshire Cyber Defense Scoring Engine aims to be a highly flexible scoring
engine for use in Cybersecurity competitions. Inspired by the Pacific Rim
Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Cheshire aims to allow greater modularity
for administrators, while also allowing automation of some currently
unautomated procedures. As an added bonus, this engine supports public and
private IPs, as well as IPv6 in the future.

NOTE:
ScoringDaemon's new name will be WhiteRabbit.
ScoringServer's new name will be CheshireCat.
The web frontend will be named Dinah.
